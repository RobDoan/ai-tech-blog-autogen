# TODO List

## Critical Issues

### Potential Resource Leaks (base_agent.py:115)
- [ ] Missing proper cleanup for AsyncIO tasks and HTTP connections
- [ ] Fix: Implement context managers or explicit cleanup in finally blocks

### Missing Rate Limiting
- [ ] No rate limiting for OpenAI API calls could lead to quota exhaustion
- [ ] Fix: Implement exponential backoff and rate limiting

## Major Issues

### Incomplete Error Recovery (blog_writer_orchestrator.py:384)
- [ ] Too broad exception handling masks specific issues
- [ ] Fix: Handle specific exception types with appropriate recovery strategies

### Performance Concerns
- [ ] Sequential agent execution could be parallelized where possible
- [ ] No caching of expensive operations (keyword analysis, etc.)
- [ ] Fix: Implement async parallel processing and intelligent caching

## Minor Issues

### Code Style (multi_agent_models.py:71)
- [ ] Using post_init in Pydantic v2 is deprecated, should use validators
- [ ] Fix: Use @model_validator(mode='after') decorator

### String Formatting (blog_writer_orchestrator.py:459)
- [ ] Raw string concatenation instead of f-strings or templates
- [ ] Fix: Use f-strings for better readability and performance
