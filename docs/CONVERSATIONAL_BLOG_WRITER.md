## Quick Start

### Basic Conversational Blog

Generate a conversational blog post with default personas:

```bash
python -m src.autogen_blog.multi_agent_blog_writer "React State Management" \
  --conversational \
  --output react_conversation.md
```

### With Research Materials

Include research materials to inform the conversation:

```bash
python -m src.autogen_blog.multi_agent_blog_writer "Machine Learning Best Practices" \
  --conversational \
  --research-folder ./research_docs \
  --output ml_conversation.md
```

### Custom Personas

Use a custom persona configuration:

```bash
python -m src.autogen_blog.multi_agent_blog_writer "DevOps Automation" \
  --conversational \
  --persona-config ./my_personas.json \
  --research-folder ./devops_research \
  --output devops_dialogue.md
```

## Configuration

### Persona Configuration

Personas are defined in JSON configuration files. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "problem_presenter": {
    "name": "Alex",
    "role": "problem_presenter",
    "background": "Full-stack developer with 3 years experience",
    "expertise_areas": ["web development", "JavaScript", "Python"],
    "communication_style": "professional",
    "personality_traits": ["curious", "practical", "detail-oriented"],
    "technical_level": "intermediate",
    "conversation_goals": [
      "Present realistic development challenges",
      "Ask practical questions",
      "Seek actionable solutions"
    ]
  },
  "solution_provider": {
    "name": "Jordan",
    "role": "solution_provider", 
    "background": "Senior software engineer and tech lead with 8 years experience",
    "expertise_areas": ["software architecture", "DevOps", "mentoring"],

  },
  "conversation_style": {
    "formality_level": "professional",
    "technical_depth": "intermediate",
    "dialogue_pace": "moderate"
  }
}
```

### Built-in Presets

The system includes several built-in persona configurations:

- **default**: Balanced professional conversation
- **beginner_friendly**: Patient, educational style for beginners
- **expert_level**: Deep technical discussions for advanced users
- **casual_chat**: Relaxed, informal developer conversation
- **formal_presentation**: Structured, professional presentation style

### Research Folder Structure

Organize your research materials in a folder:

```
research_docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ overview.md
â”œâ”€â”€ best_practices.pdf
â”œâ”€â”€ code_examples/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ example1.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ example2.js
â”œâ”€â”€ documentation.docx
â””â”€â”€ data.json
```

Supported file formats:
- **Markdown** (.md, .markdown)
- **Text** (.txt)
- **JSON** (.json, .jsonl)
- **PDF** (.pdf) - requires PyPDF2
- **Word** (.docx) - requires python-docx
- **Excel** (.xlsx) - requires openpyxl
- **CSV** (.csv)

## Advanced Usage

### Configuration Management

List available configurations:
```python
from src.autogen_blog.conversational_config_manager import ConversationalConfigManager

config_manager = ConversationalConfigManager()

# List available persona configs
personas = config_manager.list_persona_configs()
print("Available personas:", personas)

# List presets
presets = config_manager.list_presets()
print("Available presets:", presets)
```

Create custom configuration from preset:
```python
# Create custom config based on beginner_friendly preset
custom_config = config_manager.create_custom_config_from_preset(
    preset_type="beginner_friendly",
    custom_name="my_custom_config",
    modifications={
        "conversation_style": {
            "dialogue_pace": "detailed"
        }
    }
)
```

### Quality Validation

Validate conversational content quality:
```python
from src.autogen_blog.conversational_quality_validator import ConversationalQualityValidator

validator = ConversationalQualityValidator()
report = await validator.validate_quality(
    content=conversational_content,
    persona_profiles=personas,
    research_knowledge=research_knowledge
)

print(f"Overall Quality Score: {report.overall_quality_score:.2f}")
print(f"Quality Level: {report.quality_level}")
print("Recommendations:", report.recommendations)
```

### Research Processing

Process research materials independently:
```python
from src.autogen_blog.research_processor import ResearchProcessor
from src.autogen_blog.information_synthesizer import InformationSynthesizer

# Process research folder
processor = ResearchProcessor()
knowledge_base = await processor.process_folder(Path("./research"))

# Synthesize insights
synthesizer = InformationSynthesizer()
synthesized = await synthesizer.synthesize_knowledge(knowledge_base, research_files)

print(f"Found {len(synthesized.insights)} insights")
print(f"Technical concepts: {synthesized.technical_concepts}")
```

## Example Output

Here's what a conversational blog post looks like:

```markdown
# React State Management: A Developer Conversation

In this conversation, you'll follow along as two developers discuss their experiences:

**Alex**: Full-stack developer with 3 years experience. Specializes in web development, JavaScript.

**Jordan**: Senior software engineer and tech lead with 8 years experience. Expert in software architecture, mentoring.

## Understanding State Management

**Alex:** I've been working with React for a while now, but I'm still struggling with state management in larger applications. What's your approach to handling complex state?

**Jordan:** That's a great question! State management is one of those things that can make or break a React application. The key is understanding when to use local state versus when you need something more robust like Context or a state management library.

**Alex:** Can you walk me through how you decide between different approaches?

**Jordan:** Absolutely. Here's how I typically approach it:

1. **Local component state** - for simple, isolated state
2. **Lifting state up** - when multiple components need the same data  
3. **Context API** - for app-wide state that doesn't change frequently
4. **State management libraries** - for complex, frequently changing global state

Let me show you a practical example of when to use each...

## Best Practices

### Persona Design
1. **Distinct Voices**: Ensure personas have clearly different communication styles
2. **Appropriate Expertise**: Match technical level to the target audience
3. **Realistic Backgrounds**: Base personas on real developer roles and experiences
4. **Clear Goals**: Define what each persona aims to achieve in conversations

### Research Materials
1. **Quality Sources**: Use authoritative, up-to-date technical documentation
2. **Diverse Formats**: Include various types of materials (docs, examples, data)
3. **Organized Structure**: Keep research materials well-organized by topic
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep research materials current

### Content Quality
1. **Natural Flow**: Ensure conversations feel authentic and unforced
2. **Technical Accuracy**: Verify all technical claims and code examples
3. **Practical Value**: Focus on actionable insights and real-world applications
4. **Balanced Dialogue**: Maintain appropriate balance between personas

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Conversational content feels stilted or unnatural
**Solution**: 
- Adjust persona communication styles
- Use more casual language settings
- Include more questions and interactive elements

**Issue**: Technical concepts are too advanced/basic
**Solution**:
- Modify the `technical_depth` setting in conversation style
- Adjust persona technical levels
- Update target audience setting

**Issue**: Research materials not being incorporated
**Solution**:
- Check file formats are supported
- Verify research folder path is correct
- Review file permissions and encoding
- Check logs for processing errors

**Issue**: Personas sound too similar
**Solution**:
- Enhance personality traits and communication styles
- Add more distinct typical phrases
- Adjust expertise areas to create clearer differentiation

### Performance Optimization

For large research folders:
1. Limit file sizes (default max: 10MB per file)
2. Use specific file types rather than processing everything
3. Organize materials into focused subfolders
4. Monitor memory usage during processing

### Quality Improvement

To improve conversation quality:
1. Use quality validation to identify issues
2. Iterate on persona configurations based on feedback
3. A/B test different conversation styles
4. Collect feedback from target audience

## Contributing

When contributing to the conversational features:

1. **Test with Multiple Personas**: Verify changes work across different persona types
2. **Validate Quality**: Use the quality validation system to check improvements
3. **Document Changes**: Update configuration examples and documentation
4. **Consider Compatibility**: Ensure changes work with existing research processing
