# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a multi-agent collaborative blog writing system using Microsoft AutoGen. The system receives a topic and optional description or book reference, then coordinates multiple specialized agents to plan, write, critique, optimize for SEO, and add code examples to produce a high-quality markdown blog post. Each agent has a specific role in the content creation pipeline, working together to ensure comprehensive, well-written, and SEO-optimized blog content.
