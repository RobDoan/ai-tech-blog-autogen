# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing blog writing system to generate developer-focused blog posts in a conversational format. The system will create engaging dialogue between two personas - one presenting real-world development problems and another providing practical technology solutions. The AI agent will be able to consume research materials from a specified folder to inform and enrich the blog content with accurate, relevant information.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a blog content creator, I want to generate developer-focused blog posts in a conversational format, so that the content is more engaging and relatable to technical audiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a blog post THEN the system SHALL create content structured as a dialogue between two distinct personas
2. WHEN creating the dialogue THEN the system SHALL ensure one persona presents development problems/challenges and the other provides technology solutions
3. WHEN writing the conversation THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent character voices and personalities throughout the post
4. WHEN generating content THEN the system SHALL focus on practical, actionable technical advice rather than theoretical concepts
5. IF the conversation becomes too one-sided THEN the system SHALL balance the dialogue to maintain natural flow

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to provide research materials in a folder that the AI can reference, so that the blog posts are well-informed and contain accurate technical information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the blog generation command THEN the system SHALL accept a research folder path parameter
2. WHEN a research folder is provided THEN the system SHALL scan and read all supported file formats within the folder
3. WHEN processing research files THEN the system SHALL extract key information, insights, and technical details
4. WHEN writing the blog post THEN the system SHALL incorporate relevant research findings into the conversational content
5. IF research files contain conflicting information THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most recent or authoritative sources
6. WHEN no research folder is provided THEN the system SHALL still generate content using existing knowledge and topic discovery

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer reading the blog, I want the content to showcase practical skills and real-world applications, so that I can apply the knowledge directly to my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN presenting solutions THEN the system SHALL include specific technology names, frameworks, and tools
2. WHEN discussing problems THEN the system SHALL reference realistic development scenarios and challenges
3. WHEN providing code examples THEN the system SHALL ensure they are practical and implementable
4. WHEN explaining concepts THEN the system SHALL focus on "how-to" rather than "what-is" explanations
5. IF multiple solution approaches exist THEN the system SHALL present trade-offs and use cases for each

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a blog system user, I want to configure the conversational personas and style, so that the blog maintains consistent branding and voice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the conversational writer THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of persona characteristics
2. WHEN setting up personas THEN the system SHALL support defining names, backgrounds, and expertise areas
3. WHEN generating content THEN the system SHALL maintain persona consistency across multiple blog posts
4. IF persona configuration is not provided THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults for developer-focused conversations
5. WHEN updating persona settings THEN the system SHALL apply changes to subsequent blog generations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the system to integrate seamlessly with the existing blog writing pipeline, so that I can use this feature alongside current functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the conversational writer THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing topic discovery and content generation workflows
2. WHEN generating conversational content THEN the system SHALL support all existing output formats and publishing options
3. WHEN running the enhanced blog writer THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with current command-line interfaces
4. IF the conversational mode is disabled THEN the system SHALL fall back to existing blog generation methods
5. WHEN processing research folders THEN the system SHALL handle various file formats (markdown, text, PDF, JSON, etc.)
