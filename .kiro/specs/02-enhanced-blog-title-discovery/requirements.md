# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing weekly trend worker to discover specific, actionable blog post titles rather than general topic categories. Instead of finding broad topics like "Machine Learning" or "AR", the system will identify detailed, practical titles like "Why React 19 renders faster than React 18" or "How Netflix reduced API latency by 40% with GraphQL federation". The system will analyze RSS feeds and external sources to extract compelling, specific blog post ideas that would engage technical audiences.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the system to extract specific, actionable blog post titles from RSS feeds rather than general topics, so that I can create compelling content that addresses practical problems and recent developments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes RSS articles THEN it SHALL extract specific titles and headlines that indicate practical, actionable content

2. WHEN analyzing article content THEN it SHALL identify titles that follow patterns like "How [Company] achieved [Specific Result]", "Why [Technology] performs better than [Alternative]", or "[Number] ways to improve [Specific Process]"

3. WHEN extracting titles THEN it SHALL prioritize content that includes specific metrics, version numbers, company names, or concrete technical implementations

4. WHEN a title is too general (e.g., "Machine Learning Trends") THEN the system SHALL attempt to extract more specific subtopics or skip the article

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want the system to analyze article content beyond just titles to generate specific blog post ideas, so that I can discover detailed topics that might not be explicitly stated in headlines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing RSS articles THEN the system SHALL analyze article summaries and content snippets to identify specific technical implementations, performance improvements, or practical solutions

2. WHEN analyzing content THEN it SHALL extract key phrases that indicate specific problems solved, technologies used, or measurable outcomes achieved

3. WHEN generating blog post ideas THEN it SHALL combine extracted information to create specific, actionable titles like "How [Company] reduced [Metric] by [Percentage] using [Technology]"

4. WHEN multiple articles discuss similar topics THEN the system SHALL synthesize them into more comprehensive blog post ideas that compare approaches or consolidate insights

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content strategist, I want the system to score and rank blog post ideas based on their specificity and potential engagement, so that I can prioritize the most compelling and actionable content ideas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scoring blog post ideas THEN the system SHALL assign higher scores to titles that include specific metrics, version numbers, company names, or concrete technical details

2. WHEN evaluating content THEN it SHALL prioritize ideas that solve practical problems or demonstrate measurable improvements

3. WHEN ranking ideas THEN it SHALL consider factors like recency, source authority, technical depth, and potential audience interest

4. WHEN exporting results THEN it SHALL include confidence scores and reasoning for why each blog post idea was selected and ranked

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the system to provide context and supporting information for each blog post idea, so that I can understand the background and create well-informed content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extracting blog post ideas THEN the system SHALL capture relevant context including the source article, key technologies mentioned, and target audience

2. WHEN processing articles THEN it SHALL identify supporting details like code examples, performance metrics, implementation challenges, or business impact

3. WHEN generating ideas THEN it SHALL include suggested angles or approaches for covering the topic comprehensively

4. WHEN exporting results THEN it SHALL provide enough context for content creators to understand the technical depth and scope required for each blog post idea

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want the system to use AI/LLM capabilities for semantic analysis and intelligent topic extraction, so that I can discover nuanced blog post ideas that traditional keyword matching might miss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing article content THEN the system SHALL use OpenAI or similar LLM services to perform semantic analysis of article text and extract meaningful insights

2. WHEN analyzing content THEN the AI SHALL identify implicit topics, technical concepts, and practical applications that may not be explicitly stated in titles or summaries

3. WHEN generating blog post ideas THEN the LLM SHALL create specific, engaging titles based on semantic understanding of the content, following patterns like "How [Company] solved [Problem] with [Solution]" or "Why [Technology] outperforms [Alternative] in [Specific Use Case]"

4. WHEN processing multiple articles THEN the AI SHALL identify semantic relationships and suggest comprehensive blog post ideas that synthesize insights from multiple sources

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want the system to identify emerging patterns and connect related blog post ideas, so that I can create comprehensive content series or identify trending themes across multiple sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing multiple articles THEN the system SHALL identify common themes, technologies, or approaches that appear across different sources

2. WHEN detecting patterns THEN it SHALL suggest related blog post ideas that could form a content series or comprehensive guide

3. WHEN finding similar topics THEN it SHALL group related ideas and suggest ways to differentiate or combine them for maximum impact

4. WHEN exporting results THEN it SHALL include relationship indicators showing how different blog post ideas connect to broader themes or trends
