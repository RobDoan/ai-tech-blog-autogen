# Design Document

## Overview

The Enhanced Blog Title Discovery system extends the existing weekly trend worker to generate specific, actionable blog post titles using AI-powered semantic analysis. Instead of producing general topics like "Machine Learning" or "React", the system will create detailed, engaging titles such as "How Netflix reduced React bundle size by 35% with selective hydration" or "Why Stripe migrated from REST to GraphQL for payment processing APIs".

The system leverages the existing OpenAI/AutoGen infrastructure and RSS feed processing capabilities while adding sophisticated content analysis and title generation components.

## AI Integration Strategy

### OpenAI Prompt Engineering

**Content Analysis Prompt**:
```
Analyze this technical article and extract:
1. Specific technical implementations or solutions
2. Performance improvements with metrics
3. Problems solved and approaches used
4. Technologies, frameworks, or tools mentioned
5. Implicit topics not stated in the title

Article: {article_content}

Focus on actionable, specific details that would make compelling blog post topics.
```

**Title Generation Prompt**:
```
Based on this technical insight, generate 3-5 specific, engaging blog post titles that follow these patterns:
- "How [Company] achieved [Specific Result] with [Technology]"
- "Why [Technology] outperforms [Alternative] for [Use Case]"
- "[Number] ways to optimize [Process] using [Technology]"
- "How to solve [Problem] with [Innovative Solution]"

Insight: {semantic_insight}

Make titles specific, actionable, and include concrete details like metrics, version numbers, or company names when available.
```
